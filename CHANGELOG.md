## [1.0.0-rc8] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **Vietnamese i18n Support (`react-i18next`)**:
    - Installed `react-i18next`, `i18next`, `i18next-browser-languagedetector`.
    - Created `src/lib/i18n.ts` with 15 namespaces, `localStorage` language detection (key: `vyvy-lang`), bundled EN/VI resources.
    - 30 translation JSON files: `src/locales/en/` and `src/locales/vi/` covering `common`, `sidebar`, `login`, `dashboard`, `materials`, `suppliers`, `warehouses`, `purchaseOrders`, `grns`, `materialRequests`, `mins`, `deliveryOrders`, `inventory`, `reports`, `finishedProducts`.

- **Language Switcher**:
    - Globe icon + flag button at the bottom of the sidebar (AppLayout) to toggle EN ↔ VI.
    - Globe toggle on the Login page (top-right corner) for pre-authentication switching.
    - Language preference persisted in `localStorage` and restored on page load.

### Changed
- **AppLayout.tsx**: All sidebar nav labels, header text, alert messages now use `t()` translation keys from `sidebar` namespace.
- **LoginPage.tsx**: All form labels, button text, placeholders, and demo credentials text translated via `login` namespace.
- **DashboardPage.tsx**: All stat card titles, report descriptions, quick access labels, master data labels translated via `dashboard` namespace.
- **44 Module Pages**: `useTranslation` hooks injected across all materials, suppliers, warehouses, purchase orders, GRNs, material requests, MINs, delivery orders, inventory, and reports pages.

### Verified
- TypeScript build clean (`npx tsc --noEmit` — zero errors).
- Browser: Language switch works instantly, preference persists on refresh.
- Visual: Login, Dashboard, sidebar all display correctly in Vietnamese.

## [1.0.0-rc7] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **Premium Design System (`index.css`)**:
    - CSS variables for spacing, radius, transitions, shadows, sidebar/header dimensions.
    - Gradient buttons (`btn-primary`, `btn-success`, `btn-danger`), glassmorphism cards, skeleton loading with shimmer animation.
    - Enhanced table styles with sticky headers, striped rows, hover effects.
    - Modal overlay with backdrop blur and slide-in animation.
    - Utility classes: `.glass`, `.gradient-primary`, `.gradient-mesh`, `.animate-fade-in`, `.animate-slide-up`.
    - Custom scrollbar styling for sidebar.

- **AppLayout — Persistent Sidebar + Header (`AppLayout.tsx`)**:
    - Collapsible sidebar with 7 navigation groups and 17 items (Overview, Master Data, Purchasing, Production, Sales, Inventory, Reports).
    - Active route highlighting with purple accent.
    - Frosted glass header bar with notification bell (alert count badge) and user avatar dropdown.
    - Smooth collapse/expand transitions.

- **Reusable UI Components**:
    - `PageHeader.tsx`: Standardized page titles with icon, subtitle, back link, and action buttons.
    - `StatusBadge.tsx`: Unified workflow status display (draft, approved, posted, shipped, etc.) with dot indicators.
    - `ConfirmModal.tsx`: Confirmation modal with danger/warning/primary variants, backdrop blur, slide-in animation.
    - `LoadingSkeleton.tsx`: Shimmer skeleton placeholders (card, table, detail, text variants).

- **Development Environment**:
    - `.env.development` with `VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api/v1` for Vite proxy to Docker backend.

### Changed
- **Login Page**: Complete redesign with animated mesh gradient background, glassmorphism card, inline input icons (mail/lock), show/hide password toggle, demo credentials section, version footer.
- **Dashboard Page**: Removed inline navigation (now handled by sidebar), upgraded stat cards with gradient color accents and pulse indicators, added Reports & Analytics section with descriptive cards, Quick Access links with item counts, Master Data grid cards.
- **ProtectedRoute**: Now wraps all authenticated routes with `AppLayout` for persistent sidebar/header.
- **All 25+ Pages**: Removed standalone `min-h-screen bg-gray-50` wrappers and `max-w-*` containers (now handled by AppLayout), added `animate-fade-in` page transitions.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Switched from `@tailwindcss/postcss` (v4.0.0, buggy) to `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin for reliable Tailwind v4 + Vite v7 compatibility.
- **Vite Config**: Added `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin and API proxy (`/api` → Docker backend).
- **PostCSS Config**: Emptied (Tailwind now handled by Vite plugin).

### Fixed
- **Tailwind v4 Utility Classes**: Fixed `@tailwindcss/postcss` v4.0.0 `Missing field 'negated' on ScannerOptions.sources` error by upgrading to `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin.
- **Dev Server API Proxy**: Frontend dev server now correctly proxies `/api` requests to the Docker backend container.

## [1.0.0-rc6] - 2026-02-12


### Added
- **Alert System (Phase 7 Enhancement)**:
    - Backend: `AlertService` with `GetAlertSummary`, `GetLowStockAlerts`, `GetExpiringSoonAlerts(days)`.
    - Backend: `AlertHandler` with 3 new endpoints: `/api/v1/alerts/summary`, `/alerts/low-stock`, `/alerts/expiring-soon`.
    - Frontend: TypeScript types (`alert.ts`), API module (`alerts.ts`), React Query hooks (`useAlerts.ts`) with 5-min auto-refresh.
    - Frontend: Dashboard notification bell (🔔) with badge count and dropdown linking to report pages.

- **Nginx Reverse Proxy (Phase 9 - Deployment)**:
    - New `nginx.conf` with API reverse proxy (`/api/` → `backend:8080`) and SPA `try_files` routing.
    - New `.env.production` with relative API URL (`/api/v1`) so all requests go through Nginx.
    - Updated `Dockerfile` to include custom Nginx configuration.
    - Static asset caching headers and gzip compression enabled.

### Changed
- **Port Security Hardening**:
    - Removed PostgreSQL port 5432 from host exposure (internal Docker network only).
    - Removed Backend port 8080 from host exposure (all API traffic routed through Nginx on port 3000).
    - Killed stray Vite dev server on port 3001.
    - **Only port 3000 is now exposed** — single entry point through Nginx reverse proxy.
- **Dashboard**: Fixed "Total Receipts" stat card duplicating PO count → renamed to "Goods Receipts" showing pending GRN count.

### Fixed
- **Stock Movement Report**: Query used incorrect transaction types (`'receipt'` → `'GRN'`, `'issue'` → `'MIN','issue'`), causing the report to return empty results.
- **Frontend API URL**: Changed from hardcoded `http://localhost:8080/api/v1` to relative `/api/v1` via `.env.production`, enabling proper Nginx proxy routing.
- **SPA Routing**: Direct URL navigation (e.g., `/reports/stock-movement`) no longer returns Nginx 404.

### Verified
- **E2E Tests**: 27/28 API tests passed (login, dashboard, 3 alerts, 4 reports, 4 CSV exports, 10 list endpoints, MIN workflow with stock verification).
- **Browser Tests**: Login → Dashboard → GRNs → Stock Movement Report all working through Nginx proxy.
- **Docker Build**: Both `vyvy-erp_backend` and `vyvy-erp_frontend` images build successfully.

---
